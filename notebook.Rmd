### Entry 2: 2020-01-15, Wednesday   

#### Library Prep Info Updates

* RNA Seq
  * Whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing
  * Uses high thoroughout NGS (Next Gen Seq) to characterize gene expression patterns and to identify novel genes or transcripts
  * Platforms:
    * Solid
    * Ion Torrent
    * Illumina HiSeq
  * Expression at different time points, developmental stages, environment, across populations
  * Gives you functionally relevant information about what genes are actually being used
  * Can let you detect allele variants of those genes
  * Limitations:
    * Sometimes reads can be ambiguously mapped to the reference
    * Instability of mRNA
    * Can miss variation if you don't incorporate different tissues
  * Library Prep:
    * Sample collection (tissues, whole organisms)
    * RNA isolation and quality check (nanodrop, electrophoresis, qubit, bioanalyzer)
    * Ribosomal RNA depletion (rRNA) to focus on mRNA and polyA enrichment
    * Fragmentation to cut up mRNA into fragments that are the right size for sequencing platforms
    * Convert to cDNA (complementary DNA synthesis) reverse transcriptase
    * Add adaptors that may have amplification element, primary seq site, barcode, etc.
    * Amplification with PCR

* GBS
  * RADseq = Restriction site Associate DNA sequencing
    * A set of methods that start with genomic DNA and begin by digesting it with one or more restriction enzymes.
    * Adaptors (double stranded oligonucleotides) are also added for next gen sequencing.
    * Adaptors include barcodes which can be used to identify individual samples with allows multiplexing (pooling) so many samples can be sequenced as part of one library
  * Library Prep:
    * Extract DNA from samples
    * Digest DNA with one restriction enzymes (usually ApeKI), which leaves sticky ends
    * Ligate adaptors (with barcodes)
    * Multiplex
    * PCR
      * Indirect size selection for short fragments
      * Can introduce error because an allele might have a SNP at the site where the RE would usually cut, causing allele drop out

* Bisulfite Seq
  * Identifies methylated cytosine, which occur in CG islands
    * methyl added to C makes it hard for protein to interact
    * Isolate genomic DNA and treat with sodium bisulfite
    * Converts only methylated cytosine to uracil
    * PCR
    * Sequence and compare treated sample to the untreated sequence
  * Histones can be methylated or ethylated (etc.)
    * CHIPseq = Chromatin immunoprecipitation
    * Introduce a fixative to fix all protein to the DNA it's in contact with
    * Pink specific proteins that you're interested in with immunoprecipitation specificity system
      * Randomly fragment
      * Introduce an antibody
      * Antibody is attached to a pach that weighs down the protein/DNA it's attached to, to separate the protein/DNA of interest from others
    * Can sequence which parts of the DNA the protein was attached to
  * Chromatin Structure
    * ATACseq
    * Introduced manufactured transposon to fragment DNA where it's not wrapped in the chromatin
    * Transposonsattach adaptors so you can sequence
    * Fragmentation + tagging = Tagmentation
    * HiC seq
    
* Illumina Sequencing
  * Library Prep of choice
  * Cluster generation
    * Flow cell with lawn of complementary adaptors
    * Pieces of DNA with adaptors stick to lawn
    * Bridge PCR process amplifies DNA into clusters so the signal will be bright enough
  * Sequencing by synthesis
    * Fluorescent dNTPs
    * Signal of fluorescence recorded as DNA grows
  * Types: miSeq, HiSeq, Sanger
  
* PacBio/Oxford Nanopore
  * Long read sequencers
  * SMRT
    * PacBio
      * Polumerase is fixed in a well and the DNA moves through it
      * we know where the site of incorporation is going to be so you can fix a laser there
      * Fluorescent signal is read at that fixed point
      * To reduce error, they make sequence circular so it goes through multiple times
    * ONT
      * Nanopore
      * Combination of proteins: motor and one that sits in membrane
      * Single strand of DNA goes through pore
      * Current across membrane
    * Synthetic: Uses short reads with barcoding to stitch them together after
      * Illumina
      * 10x genomics (Immersion)
      * They partition longer fragments until they're in the lower frequency and then chop them up and give them barcodes
    * Inaccurate and expensive compared to short read sequencing
    * Good for highly repetitive regions

### Entry 3: 2020-01-22, Monday   

##### Library Prep Info Updates Part 2
* Amplicon Seq
  * Amplicon: a piece of DNA/RNA that is product or source of amplification
    * Undergoes simplification, replicated genetic material
    * Direct repeat (head to tail)
    * Inverted repeat (head to head or tail to tail)
    * Amplicon usually interchangeable with term PCR product
    * PCR -> pooled -> sequenced together
    * Multiplexing
    * Can use for:
      * Genome targeting
      * Detection of hotspot mutations
      * Detection of gene fusion
      * SNPs
      * Metagenomics (biodiversity assessment)
    * Preparation
      * Sample selection (environmental samples, 'mock communities', etc
      * DNA/RNA extraction
      * Quantify using Qubit, etc.
      * ITS (fungal), CO1 (insects),  16SRNA (bacterial, ~450 bp)
      * Library prep: 
        * Samples
        * 1st PCR step
        * Add primer and head target (allows barcode to attach)
        * Purification
        * 2nd PCR: amplify your PCR products with primers that have library specific barcode
        * Purification (can use magnetic beads, magnetic stand, etc)
        * Pool samples into library that is sent to be sequenced
      * Why use 2 PCR steps? Only 1 leads to problems which can be remediated

* Exon capture sequencing
  * Focused on high value genomic regions so you can have high coverage sequences of prespecified regions
  * Exon = protein coding region of the gene
  * Exome = the portion of the genome that encodes for exons
  * Biomedical uses: disease variants most likely in exome
  * Ecological evolution: genetic mapping of locally adapted traits, fine scale mapping for phenotypic expression, can detect selection in genome, provides info of life history and molecular evolution, phylogenetic reconstruction, ancient DNA (aDNA)
  * Library prep
    * Sample collection
    * Fragmentation of the DNA
      * Fragment soup of DNA fragments with blunt ends, fragments same length, adenine tails are added, same adaptor is added to both ends of the fragments
    * Enriching library
      * Pool DNA that corresponds to exons, must create probes to capture DNA fragments with different methods:
        * PCR: range of targeted loci ~100, genomic knowledge needed of PCR primer sequences
        * De novo: range of targeted loci 100s-1000s, knowledge needed of transcriptome, RADseq, or whole genome sequences
        * Divergent annotated genome: 100s-1000s loci, knowledge needed of annotated genome
    * Purify and collect targeted DNA

### Entry 4: 2020-01-27, Monday.   

#### Population Genomics
* Selection and drift across the genome
  * Motivation? 
    * Climate change -> change in abundance and distribution of species, and changes in selection
  * Challenging: signals of abundance/distribution (demographic history) are very difficult to tell from selection
  * Why study across the whole genome?
    * Inherently variable environment
    * Studying across the genome prevents bias from sampling only a few places along the genome
    * Linkage disequilibrium
    * Selection acts locally and demographic changes affect everywhere in the genome
  * Demographic history
    * Ne = effective population size, the size that a population behaves as if it were an idealized wright fisher population
      * Captures the effect of population size on drift
    * Migration (gene flow) among populations
    * Coalescent theory (Kingman, Watterson, Tajima, Hudson)
      * What is the probability that any two randomly sampled allele copies came from the same parent allele the generation before
      * 2Ne allele copies in a population of size Ne ind.
      * Pr(common ancestor) = 1/2Ne
      * Eventually coalesces to the common ancestor of the entire sample
      * Want to sample many genes, it's a stochastic process
      * Can estimate what pop size was doing based on how often you're seeing coalescent events
    * Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS)
      * Wright fisher population has many rare mutations
      * If pop is growing, there will be a lot of rare mutations and few common alleles
      * If a pop that has gone through a bottleneck, what you’re likely to lose is the rare lineages and the ones that make it through weren't rare before the bottleneck
  * Selection
    * Positive selection - selection increasing frequency of a beneficial allele
      * Pi = nucleotide diversity
      * Pi over chromosome, pi will decrease where there is selection because one allele is favored
      * With linkage disequilibrium, sites around the selected sites will also have decreased pi and there will be high linkage disequilibrium -> hitchhiking
      * Bushy topology = just recovering after a selective sweep
      * Same signature as population expansion
      * Tajima's D will be very negative for selective sweep and growing population

### Entry 5: 2020-01-29, Wednesday   
(Absent from class)

* Difference between Rmd vs. md?
  * Markdown is a type of language that renders it into something readable
  
* Learning Objectives
  * Background on species
  * Understand the pipeline
  * Bash scripts
  * Sequencing quality assessment
  * Mapping to ref genome
  
* Red Spruce: Cool moist climates, northerly distributed, higher in elevation as you move south
  * Genetic basis of climate adaptation
  * Highly fragmented populations
  * Alleles that might be potentially conserved
  * Inform nature conservancy to improve restoration
  
* Genomic DNA from needles (110 Mother trees, 23 pops)
  * Red genome based on multiple tissues and developmental stages in related species white spruce
  * 80,000 proves were designed based on these transcriptomes (120 bp)
  * coverage of at least one prove for 38,570 unigenes (90 bp, 85% coverage)
  * fragmentation, hybridization with probes, sequenced on a Hiseq X to generate paired end 150 bp reads
    * single end only one end is paired
    * Paired ends two ends are sequenced, more powerful than single end

#### Pipeline
1. Visualize, Clean, Visualize
  * Visualize the quality of raw data (Program: FastQC)
  * Clean raw data (Program: Trimmomatic)
  * Visualize the quality of cleaned data (Program: FastQC)
2. Calculate #s of cleaned, high quality reads going into mapping
3. Map (a.k.a. Align) cleaned reads from each sample to the reference assembly to generate sequence alignment files (Program: bwa, Input: .fastq, Output: .sam)
4. Remove PCR duplicates identified during mapping and calculate alignment statistics (% of read mapping successfully, mapping quality scores, average depth of coverage per individual)

We'll then use the results of out mapping next week to start estimating diversity and population structure.

### Entry 6: 2020-02-03, Monday.   

#### Settepani et al., 2017 
* Evolution of sociality in spiders leads to depleted genomic diversity at both population and species level

* Effective population size
  * Ne = 4(number males*number females)/(n males + n females)
  * Common in social pops to have unequal sex ratio with fewer males, so the Ne will be limited by the number of reproducing males


* Metapopulation dynamics
* Propagule pool model

### Entry 7: 2020-02-05, Wednesday   

#### My population is DG

Qs from last week:
* paired reads are the ones we want to visualize because unpaired ones don't have partners that passed quality score. Paired useful for genome assembly, etc.

Learning Objectives

1. Reviewing our progress on read cleaning and visualizing QC
2. start mapping each set of cleaned reads to a reference genome
3. visualize seq alignment files
4. process our sam files by
  * converting to binary (bam) format and sorting by coordinates
  * removing PCR duplicates
  * indexing for fast future lookup
5. calculate mapping stats to assess quality of the result
6. learn how to put separate bash scripts into a "wrapper" that runs them all

* Mapping cleaned and trimmed reads against the ref genome
  * reference genome from Norway spruce (congenie.org)
  * pull out contigs from ref that contained one or more of our probes -> 668,000,000 bp reduced reference genome
  * genome isn't assembled into chromosomes, they're in contigs that are in some order (we don't know, which is typical for non-model organisms)
  * Indexed, reduced ref genome to use for mapping is on server here:
  `/data/project_data/RS_ExomeSeq/ReferenceGenomes/Pabies1.0-genome_reduced.fa`
  * N50 = gives a metric of the state of the assembly, how much of the genome is assembled into big contigs instead of small ones
    * sort contigs in order of size
    * take 50% of size (334 Mbp), start with biggest contigs and go until you have summed up that many Mbps
    * N50 is size of smallest contig that which the sum of contigs that size and larger equal 50% of the total size
    * you want it to be a big number to tell you at least half is assembled into big contigs
    * 101,375 bp is the N50 size for us
    * small is ok, but bigger gets you more spatial information, closer to the actual chromosomes
* We're going to write script in text editor
* test it for just one ind before running for all
* can kill scripts with ctrl+C


* on server: `git pull` to get scripts we wrote today
* to make file executable (if you do `ll` and the file names aren't green): `chmod u+x *.sh`

* at command prompt with nothing else running: `screen` and then `bash mypipeline.sh` and then ctrl+A and then ctrl+D `screen -r` (remember to detach again with ctrl+A and ctrl+D)
